This is a sample application from the open source project Android Network Tools. If you are looking for a more complete network scanning tool, please see my other app Portdroid.

It demonstrates the following features of the library:

• Pinging
• Port Scanning
• Finding devices on your network
• Wake-on-lan

The project is hosted on github. Bug reports, feature requests and contributions are all welcome:
